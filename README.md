## About the Project
This C++17 project offers a friendly user interface for a hypothetical gardening store (using the C++ gtkmm library). The store's structure is based on a number of classes that work together through object-oriented programming. [UML class diagrams](https://github.com/RobertCarrUTA/Mavs-Arboretum-Store/blob/main/UML-Class-Diagram-Requirements.png) guided the design of the program.

## Project Demo Video
[Click here to see the project demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdmtEtFTomY).

## Compile Instructions
The following compile instructions are for Ubuntu. In addition, we assume you have all the required files and are entering them in the directory containing those files.
* compile: Using the terminal, navigate to the directory where these files are located, and then enter "make" to compile the program.
* run: Using the directory where "make" was run, enter "./manga"
* clean: Enter "make clean" to delete the executable file and all its object files

## SCRUM Spreadsheet
The SCRUM spreadsheet for the project can be found by [clicking here](/Scrum_MANGA.ods).

## Project TODO Items
* Organize the repository into folders while still preserving the Makefile and its commands.
